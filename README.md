Introduction of sensor
----------------------------  
The AGM8833 is a high Precision Infrared Array Sensor based on Advanced MEMS Technology.

***
Usage  
=======
Download all the source files.  
There are two examples for user.  
>* **exambles/basic_demo.ino**,From this example,you can get the 64 channels(8X8) IR sensor raw data from serial-watch-window.  
>* **exambles/TFT_screen_demo.ino**,From this example,we use a [TFT screen](https://www.seeedstudio.com/2.8-TFT-Touch-Shield-V2.0-p-1286.html) to show the 8X8 matrix data,Different data map different   colors.So we can make a simple„ÄÅlow resolution thermal imaging display system.Through this visual interface, you can see the results   very intuitively

In addition:  
---------------------
There is a INT pad on Seeed's AMG8833 module,This pad correspond to INT pin,when sensor generate a interruption(usually the temperature beyond limit),The pin turns to low,Otherwise stays high.Without this INT pin,you need to polling for sensor result value.
